# Ghostup
### A game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 28

![gif](http://leafo.net/dump/ghostup.png)

You're a measly ghost strapped for cash. Head to the human world to haunt
strangers and earn some extra ghost bucks. Be careful, you're not very strong
so you'll only have a single haunt before you evaporate. Buy some upgrades with
your ghost bucks to go deeper into the human world.

Watch out for red ghosts, they can suck your life away. Dodge them or try to
haunt them to oblivion.

It's not as done as I would like (which you'll see if you get to the end) but I
hope you enjoy it regardless.

### Controls

Arrows move
X to haunt
Z to open doors (if you have a key)

### How to play

You only start with one haunt, but you can keep replaying the game with
accumulated upgrades. Try to haunt some humans to get some cash, then buy
additional health and haunts that will allow you to advance further in the
game.

Red ghosts will hurt you if you touch them. If you are careful you can kill
them by haunting them, or you can just avoid them.
